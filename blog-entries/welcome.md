I've been meaning to set up a blog which I can use to write about technical things for a while now, and so here it is; welcome to my blog. There isn't much here just yet, but I'll be writing about all things JavaScript/TypeScript related, AWS stuff, my journey into becoming better at accessibility, and general other nerdery.

Watch this space.
